A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair. The scheduler selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them. The bankerâ€™s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes a safe state check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. In this project we have implemented Shortest Job First, Priority and Multilevel Queue algorithm for scheduling. The implementation of Multilevel Queue is done using two queues, System Process Queue and User Process Queue, and in each queue, we have given choice to implement that queue with SJF or Priority Based Scheduling. After scheduling of processes is done, we apply Bankers Algorithm to ensure that there is no deadlock among the process. The result of applying these two algorithms one after other is that we get an order of processes which ensures that there is no deadlock and also scheduling is also taken care of.
